Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

*Software engineering can be defined as the process of developing solutions for problems in the real world using technology*

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Practical Milestones
Milestones in action 
Real life milestones

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Research and Strategy
Developing the product
Solutiion
Testing 
Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages

#Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

What Software Developer,a Quality Assurance Engineers and a Project Manager . Design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures. Document software defects, using a bug tracking system, and report defects to software developers. Identify, analyze, and document problems with program function, output, online screen, or content.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. Efficient branching and merging capabilities allow developers to work concurrently on various aspects of a project without interference, significantly reducing the time from development to deployment. while for IDE they can be Code editor UI enhancements Automated testing features Code deployment support via plugin integration Code refactoring support Application packaging support

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Lack of Workflow Visibility · 2. Broken SDLC Processes · 3. Lack of Predictability In Software Delivery · 4. The Problems With Development Velocity

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is a type of software testing in which individual units or components of the software are tested.
Primary Objective: The main objective of unit testing is to isolate each component of the software and then perform tests to illustrate that every individual component is accurately meeting the requirements and delivering the expected output.
System testing is software testing in which all components are tested together (as a whole) to ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements.
Primary Objective: The main objective of this level of testing is to make sure that the software/product meets specified requirements and runs as smoothly as possible in its operating environment. 
Acceptance testing is a type of software testing that determines whether or not the software should be released to the public.
Primary Objective: The main objective of acceptance testing is to evaluate whether the software complies with the end-user requirements and whether it is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data. Further, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
